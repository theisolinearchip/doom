- WAD loading and version (hardcoded now with custom param)

- scaling factor currently hardcoded (check params)

- grabMouse param currently hardcoded (check params)

- demo version check stupidly patched: allows VERSION (110 and a harcoded 109 for those WADs

- version detection: some versions are filename-based, maybe I'll add some params requirement?

- cleaning stuff, always :_ D
